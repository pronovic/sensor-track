As of January 2025, I have migrated my home automation infrastructure
from SmartThings to Home Assistant, so I no longer use this software.  It does
work, and is still a decent example of how to write a compliant SmartApp using
my smartapp-sdk library.  However, the repository is archived and you should
consider this code to be unmaintained.
