These sample files were taken from the [SmartApp Lifecycles](https://developer-preview.smartthings.com/docs/connected-services/lifecycles/) page.

Nearly all of them had to be modified slightly, because the JSON on that page is not actually valid - for instance,
there are illegal trailing commas.  

I fixed the syntax errors, and in one case added a `settings` dict (since it was empty). Other than that, I have left
these requests as-is.  The samples amount to interface documentation, since there is not actually a formal interface spec.
